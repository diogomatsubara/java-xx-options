This repo is a documentation repository for the many -XX Java JVM options.

The list came from: http://stas-blogspot.blogspot.com/2011/07/most-complete-list-of-xx-options-for.html

All I did was to format it to markdown. And having it here and not in someone's blogpost also makes it easier to update and keep it up to date.
